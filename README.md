#Model Performance-
* The graph compares the performance of different models based on evaluation metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared scores. 
* The Random Forest model shows the lowest MSE and MAE values, indicating better accuracy and precision in predicting the target variable, with an R-squared score of 0.95 demonstrating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual value, hence it is the better fit model.

#Challenges faced- 
* Evaluating different regression algorithms and overcoming challenges in gridsearchCV to finely tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.
* Employing techniques like Cross Validation and extra tree regressor to uncover influential features that play a crucial role in shaping the model's predictions.


#Learning- 
We got better at using regression tools, tweaking settings, and finding important features by taking help of online resources.
